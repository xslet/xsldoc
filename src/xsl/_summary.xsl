 xsldoc is a XSLT application to print an API document in a XSL file on Web browsers.

 xsldoc prints the lists of design items: namespaces, import files, include files, parameters, elements, and functions in a XSL file. Note that namespaces are not printed on Firefox because Firefox does not support XPath's namespace axis (namespace::*).

 xsldoc regards design items of which the local name starts with '_' as private items and does not print them.

 This file is written in XSLT 1.0.
