 xsldoc is a XSLT applet to print an API document of a XSL file on Web browsers. 

 This applet prints the lists of design items of XSLT: namespaces, import files, including files, parameters, elements (matching templates), and functions (named templates). However, this applet regards design items of which the local-name starts with '_' as private items and doesn't print them.

 This applet also prints design comments, which are comments that immediately precede these design items and start with `**`.

 This file is written in XSLT 1.0.
